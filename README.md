# Users

  To run this application you should run the publish profiles for UsersWeb and UsersApi projects. After that go to IIS and add a new website
for each project, each one with the location of the publish output folder generated by the publish profiles. 
  UserApi must run on https://localhost:8092.
  The list of users displayed is loaded by UsersApi from json file FakeUsers.json which can be found in the root folder of the application. Each valid change from the UI, will be saved in this json file.
